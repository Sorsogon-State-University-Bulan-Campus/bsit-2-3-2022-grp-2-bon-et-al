    The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. 

🖼 Essentially, the purpose of photography is to communicate and document moments in time. When you take a photograph and share it with others, you're showing a moment that was frozen through a picture. This moment can tell someone many things, from the environment to what people are doing.This project aims to provide knowledge about photography. With the use of this platform, we can share tips and tutorials on how to achieve great photos. We want to be a part of your achievements and success in the field of photography. We also want to encourage and inspire others in terms of photography.


## 🧠FAQs(Frequently Asked Questions)🧠

### 🤔 How do you find balance with life and photography?
✍✍✍ Making a schedule and sticking to it is very important. If you have shoots to edit (personal or commissioned), pick a time each day to dedicate to editing and stick to it. If you like to blog, pick a day of the week that you will carve out time to blog.

### 🤔What gear do I need to achieve great photos?
✍✍✍ The gear you have in your bag is a personal preference and really depends on what type of photography you are interested in. It is recommended to start your journey with the “nifty 50,” AKA a 50mm prime lens.

All major manufacturers have great 50mm options and this really is a fantastic starter lens. After you have explored with the 50mm lens, you can try your hand at more wide angle and telephoto focal lengths. If zoom is appealing to you, there are plenty of zoom lenses out there, however you will hear many professional photographers who swear by prime lenses (lenses that do not zoom).

### 🤔 What does manual mode mean and do I have to learn it?
✍✍✍ Manual mode puts the photographer in complete control of how the photo will turn out. You have to manually set both the aperture, ISO, and the shutter speed. You can take this a few steps further and control the white balance, too. The camera will not make any automatic changes to the exposure. Your camera will still guide you to the best exposure with its built in meter.
For example, the following two images were taken at the same time. These are merely snapshots taken to demonstrate the power of manual mode. The first was taken in full auto mode and the second was taken in full manual mode. As you can see, the manual mode is better exposed and more pleasing to the eye. The image taken in auto is out of focus because the camera chose a slow shutter speed in attempt to expose it properly. Both of these images are straight out of camera.

### 🤔How do you achieve sharp focus?
✍✍✍ Focus can be one of the most frustrating elements of photography when you are first starting out. Nailing focus could be an entire article in and of itself. There are many factors that go into getting a sharp image, but there are two focusing methods that help you to stay in control of focus rather than relying on the camera’s autofocus function. Chances are most professional photographers are using one of these methods and that is why their images are sharp.

### 🤔 Do you really have to edit all your photos?
✍✍✍ In a word, yes. While it is best to nail an image in camera, editing is how it all comes together to become a finished image. Some photographers are more artistic with their editing and some are more clean. This is really just a personal preference and will come with time.

###  🤔 Do I have to be in business to be called a pro?
✍✍✍ No!! There are many photographers who are not in business and they are incredible! You absolutely do not need to be in business to be respected or taken seriously.
